## 📌 What You'll Find Here
Since my professional work is confidential, my public repositories may not fully reflect my expertise. The content of the repos are mainly filled with projects done during my bachelor's degree. However, I stay active in:
- Studying architectures
- Exploring **best practices & new technologies**
- Occasionally sharing **code snippets & proof-of-concepts**
- Studying Kubernetes
